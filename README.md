# ViewLifecycle

Use plain android Views without Fragments, still having direct access to Lifecycle, ViewModel etc. 
Navigate with old well-known families of methods ViewGroup.addView and ViewGroup.removeView.

See [todo app sample](https://github.com/es-andreev/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvvm-live-kotlin-fragmentless) based on this library.
